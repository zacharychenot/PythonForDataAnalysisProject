# Final Project : Python for Data Analysis 
## Estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition Data Set
### _Thomas CULINO & Zachary CHENOT_


## Project Overview
For our Final Project we have been given a dataset that includes data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. We created a model that predicts your weight range depending on some variables.

With this files you can also find our notebook where we analysed the data and tested our models. You can also find the dataset and the code to use Flask.

## How to use our project on Flask
All you have to do is to launch the code on spyder or any python launcher, then access to this address :



http://localhost:5000/Height=/xxx/Weight=/xxx
and change the xxx values to get the predictions of our model.
