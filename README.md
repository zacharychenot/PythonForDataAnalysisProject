# Final Project : Python for Data Analysis 
## Estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition Data Set
### _Thomas CULINO & Zachary CHENOT_


## Project Overview
For our Final Project we have been given a dataset that includes data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. We created a model that predicts your weight range depending on some variables.

With this files you can also find our notebook where we analysed the data and tested our models. You can also find the dataset and the code to use Flask.


## How to use our project on Flask
Before lauching the code you need to download the database and our python code. Then you have to put the data file and the python code in the same folder.
Otherwise, you must write the path to access the database file.

Then, you have to launch the code. you should get something like this in the console :

Then all you have to do is access to this address on your browser :

http://localhost:5000/Height=/xxx/Weight=/xxx
and change the xxx values corresponding to your height and weight to get the predictions of our model.
